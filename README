Submitted Files

README - This file.
JackAnalyzer - JACK file .jack to XML file .xml
Makefile - make file
JackAnalyzer.py - Parses jack file to xml file
JackTokenizer.py - Takes jack file and creates tokens object
CompilationEngine.py - Compiles the token object to xml file by the grammer rules

Remarks
-------
I got a path.
If it was a folder, I took all its .jack files and translated to xml files by the grammers rules.
Each file translated to xml with the same name to the same directory.
Else, I got a path to an .jack file.
I took the path of each file and a first read it all the one line.
Then i removed all the comments and created array of tokens.
Then the compilation engine compiled all the token by the grammer rules to sinle string.
That string was saved to new xml file.
The file created by the jack analyzer is the .xml file we wanted.
The compilation engine is not the most brilliant but it works good.
